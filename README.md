DESCRIPTION:

    
     
     
     SmartCart Checkout is a clean and interactive checkout summary page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically displays products added to the cart, calculates the total price in real-time, allows users to remove individual items, and simulates a basic "Place Order" action. All cart operations are handled entirely on the frontend with a simple and responsive UI design â€” ideal for learning core DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic in a real-world e-commerce context.
